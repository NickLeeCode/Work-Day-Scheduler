#Work Day Scheduler

- The first thing I started with is adding new time blocks to the scheduler. I copied the existing time blocks and pasted the amount I needed and I just chnaged the hour time so that they are as increasing in numeric order.
- The second thing I did was adding in the past, present, and future class to all of the time blocks
- The third thing I did was that I added the local storage to the save buttons, so that when you add a task to the time block then clicked the same button. The task would be saved in the local storage
- the fourth thing I added was wrap everything in a jquery function so that everything would work
